There are a few main stations that seem to have the longest trip duration. Since trip duration directly impacts revenue, it would be likely these stations are the most profitable. Also with the longest trip duration, are the males. 

Understanding the realities of the pandemic, the rides picked up substantially just after all of the shutdowns. As of June, the shutdowns really loosened, it is shown by the increased number of rides. April, surprisingly, was the hardest hit, even though most of March was shut down in the city. 

The most popular stations are by the water and in the middle of the city. This is where future expansions of pickup places or stores should be, as it seems this is where the tourists like to bike. It also seems tourists in the downtown area have the longest trip duration. The most money is spent on bikes in Times Square and Central Park areas.
